# To - Do App

 This repository contains code for a to - do app
 
 <br><br><br>
 
## What is it all about?
The repository contains HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript files which are used to create a to-do app project by me( Mabawonku Joshua ). The app documentation will be discussed below. The App allows you to solve most problems relating to to-do's in your browser such as:

- [x] Saving and Retrieving your to-do's
- [x] Live modification of your To-do's tasks objective
- [x] Adding and Removing Tasks from your To-do's
- [x] Searching for tasks in your To-do's

==***If you're interested, keep reading..***==

## App Documentation( Features Of This App )

The App basically allows you to create and manipulate to-do's/daily tasks in a very simple and effective way. It's features are given below:

- **Saving and Retrieving your to-do's:**<br>
The App auto saves your to-do's/tasks directly to your browser's storage and it also automatically retrieves them when you open the App's Web page in your browser .. so no need for all those save buttons or even non-saving feature and other jargon you see around in other browser-based to-do apps.

- **Live modification of your To-do's tasks objective:**<br>
The App allows you perform live modification of your to-do's tasks objective. With this, you don't need to start having to delete and re-add tasks when you can just edit the tasks if you misplaced their priority in the list.

> **To Edit a task/to-do's objective**: just double-click on the objective's text and enter your new objective in the browser's prompt, then save( or click OK ). the former objective will be modified to your new objective.

- **Adding and Removing Tasks from your To-do's:**<br>
The App has buttons to help add, delete and done-check a task. This buttons are pretty intuitive. With this, You can easily add a task or delete it and even set it as done

> There is a big add task button below the list in the app, you click on it to create tasks.( N.B: Setting a task as urgent will make it to be created at the top of the list instead of the bottom. )... there are also two icons( a check icon and a trash icon ), clicking on the check is used to mark a task as done and it'll cause the task to be deleted from the list while the clicking on the trash icon just basically deletes the task from the list

- **Searching for tasks in your To-do's:**<br>
We all know organizing a large mount of tasks can be a pain in the ass. So we made the app to also have a search feature which allows you to find tasks and manipulate them on the go.

> There is a big search button above the list in the app, you click on it to search for tasks.( N.B: the search feature is case-sensitive and does not allow you to perform mistakes in manipulation. Also, the results provided are read-only that means no live changes are made on the tasks in the results box, but instead they are implemented on the task in the list )
